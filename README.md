## Description of the subject area on which the object model should be built:

Alice frowned: Alice showed the visitors some kind of clumsy structure, resembling either a folded tent or a large umbrella. Alice pressed the button on the handle of the alleged umbrella, and immediately the umbrella spread out, turning into a small table with a chair. Hatter sat down at the table, for which he had to bend his legs in the most unnatural way. Hatter felt neither comfort nor inspiration - on the contrary, he felt that his legs were starting to ache brutally. Therefore, he decided to quickly turn the conversation to something else and, getting out from behind the table. 

*Additional text:*

Hatter asked:- "Tell me, please, what book did you write?"
“I haven’t written a single book yet,” admitted Alice.
Hatter thinks it would be nice to come up with a machine that could be a writer. "You're right," Alice  agreed.

- The program must implement 2 of its own exception classes (checked and unchecked), as well as exception handling of these classes.
- You must add the use of local, anonymous, and nested classes (static and non-static) to your program.
